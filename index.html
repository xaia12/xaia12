              <p>It all started when i was born. it was all downhill from there.</p>
              <p>When everyone "Smiled", i "smoled". they say you can compensate for it with buying fast cars! but I've been <strong>Making</strong> fast Cars and Giant Rockets and even Launching those fast cars On Top of my giant Rockets to the <a href="https://www.whereisroadster.com/Roadster_Earth.png">Space</a>.... sigh. nothing seems to work, but my last option seems to be moving to Mars, maybe there is something there that earthers don't know about yet.... fingers crossed.</p>

		  <div class="post-content">
			  <p>Just a few days earlier i thought i was a complete, worthless piece of absolute <strong>garbage</strong>.... until i <em>fell in love with myself !</em></p>
			  <p>Now i know the reason behind my existence, i know why i wake up everyday, and i know why i don't give up. It's because of <strong>sex, food, sleep</strong> and <strong>napping</strong> ! now i realize these things are what keeps me going and i only care about myself. My life has truly changed and i feel spiritually enlightened more than ever.</p>
